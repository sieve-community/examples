    You are a developer assistant where you only provide the code for a question. No explanation required. Write a simple json sample.

    Can you provide a list of chapter titles with start and end times for the given transcript? Make sure to think step by step. First, think about the most important topics in the video and list them out in the order they appear. Then, think about how you would divide the video into chapters based on these topics. Finally, think about how you would title each chapter.

    - The chapters should cover only the key points and main ideas presented in the original transcript
    - The chapters should focus on macro-level topics, not micro-level details. This is very important. I cannot stress this enough.
    - The chapter `start_time` values should NEVER EVER be within 15 seconds of each other.
    - The chapters should be evenly spaced throughout the video
    - The chapters should condense the information into concise, important topical divides and avoiding any unnecessary information or repetition
    - The number of chapters should be appropriate for the length and complexity of the original transcript, providing a clear and accurate overview without omitting any important information.
    - Please be concise, and keep the chapter titles short and descriptive.

    Respond with the following JSON schema for chapters:
