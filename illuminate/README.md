I have not made this into a sieve function yet. It dictates an openai chat in two given voices with contextual emotion and pacing.


Setup:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python  scripts/get_voices.py
```

Run local example:
```
python dictate.py
```
